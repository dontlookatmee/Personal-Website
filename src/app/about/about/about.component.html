      <h2>Daniel Pashaliyski</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Daniel a innovative Front-End developer who loves to code. I don’t
        like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work
        I want to do, skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to
        keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things
        that matter, fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm.

      <h2>01.Coding</h2>
      <p>
        I'm coding in every free second I have, I just love doing it, it makes
        my thinking structured and the sheer joy of making things. At the end of
        the day, you have created something that didn’t exist that morning, and
        that is in and of itself satisfying. The joy of always learning, which
        springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. Most of all, it
        teaches me a lot about myself.

      <h2>02.Sport</h2>
      <p>
        Sports is obsession, sports is aesthetically pleasing. I started
        sporting when I was 10 years old, I feel obsessed of it and I've never
        stopped since then. It is like the theater, it is a venue for emotional
        expression. It is an escape from real-world troubles. It is a sense of
        belonging, a connection to a wider world. Sport is powerful tool for
        developing life skills.

      <h2>03.Nature</h2>
      <p>
        I've grown up in a small mountain village where all you could do as a
        kid is go and play inside the forest. Nowdays I rarely miss a day in
        which I'm not going in the forest to concentrate myself, clear my
        thoughts and free it from anxiety. It offers you an understanding of the
        cycle of life and how each creation connects with each other. I love
        being part of the nature, I feel connected to it.
